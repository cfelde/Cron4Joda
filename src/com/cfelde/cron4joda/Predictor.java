/**
 * <p>
 * A predictor is able to predict when a scheduling pattern will be matched.
 * </p>
 * <p>
 * Suppose you want to know when the scheduler will execute a task scheduled
 * with the pattern <em>0 3 * jan-jun,sep-dec mon-fri</em>. You can predict the
 * next <em>n</em> execution of the task using a Predictor instance:
 * </p>
 *
 * <pre>
 * String pattern = &quot;0 3 * jan-jun,sep-dec mon-fri&quot;;
 * Predictor p = new Predictor(pattern);
 * for (int i = 0; i &lt; n; i++) {
 * 	System.out.println(p.nextMatchingDate());
 * }
 * </pre>
